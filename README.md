### Brief Description:
In this project, we used a mix of interactive and static visualizations to explore trends in Citi Bike usage and deployment across Manhattan. An **interactive time-layered map** highlighted how station coverage has expanded from 2014 to 2024. To compare rider behavior, we used a **heatmap** for electric vs. classic bike usage and a **bar plot** to contrast member vs. casual rider patterns by neighborhood.

A **circular network** graph visualized trip flows between neighborhoods, while a **hexbin plot** examined the relationship between ride duration and distance during peak summer months. Seasonal usage trends were captured with a **line chart**, showing how ridership fluctuates over the year.

We also included a **comparative table** to examine infrastructure alignment, showing the number of bike and subway stations per neighborhood and their proximity. Lastly, an **interactive map overlaying average income and station count** helped us assess the equity of station distribution.

Each visualization was designed to reveal a different dimension of the dataâ€”from spatial growth and rider demographics to network flow and social context.
